ex1.c

The program prompts the user with "Please enter a number from 1 to 5:\n" (note the newline after the colon), reads the user's response, and then prints "1 Hello World" (with a newline at the end), "2 Hello World", "3 Hello World", etc. as many times as indicated by the user's response, and terminates. If the user enters a number that is outside of the 1..5 range, the program prints the error message "Number is not in the range from 1 to 5" (with a newline at the end), and terminates.

ex2.c

The program requests five single-precision floating-point numbers (floats), and prints their sum, minimum, maximum, and product to 4 decimal places. Specifically, the program prompts the user with this message "Enter five floating-point numbers:\n" (note the newline after the colon). It prints the sum, minimum, maximum and product formatted exactly as shown (to 4 decimals):

ex3.c

The program requests six integers ("Enter six integers:\n") (note newline after colon), reads all of them, then prints all of them in the following format: (i) first print a header line as shown in the example below; then (ii) two integers per line, with each integer right-justified in a field of 10 characters, separated by two blank spaces. Each of the integers supplied could be in either decimal, octal or hexadecimal format, and your program should read it correctly. For output, each integer is printed in decimal format.
