The program prompts the user with "Please enter a number from 1 to 5:\n" (note the newline after the colon), reads the user's response, and then prints "1 Hello World" (with a newline at the end), "2 Hello World", "3 Hello World", etc. as many times as indicated by the user's response, and terminates. If the user enters a number that is outside of the 1..5 range, the program should print the error message "Number is not in the range from 1 to 5" (with a newline at the end), and terminate.
